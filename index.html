        To my dearest Love,<br><br>
        I’m sorry that this gift has been a little delayed, but It was due to making sure I was putting my whole heart and effort into creating this little script! I wanted to do something that was crafty and handmade, but I am just a tech nerd now so this is the medium I've chosen to dive into hehe. 

        It’s crazy that we’ve hit two years together now, I can tell you that it truly is the best 2 years of my life yet. Through every high and low, we have grown together, learning, evolving, and deepening our bond. In a way, working on creating this for you represents my dedication that I feel towards you my love. To continue to work on becoming the wholesome, little people we want to become bit by bit. I want the future we talk about together, the peaceful and love-filled life we’re cultivating, and the sweet little beans we’ll collect along the way! Taking the next step of my life with you by my side, starting a career and hopefully having much more time to live it fully and create lasting memories that are happening right now. When we are old, I want us to look back on a life filled with love, laughter, and all the little joys we gathered along the way during these time .I love you more than I can express with words, but I'll continue to try year after year to describe what true beauty you are to me. Happy valentines and happy 2 years beanie baby, I love you to the bunny making stew and back ❤️
        <br><br>
        Forever yours,<br>
        Beanie Baby🌞
